        <strong><p>Directions: </p></strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 deg F.</li>
            <li>Slice avocados lengthwise and remove the pit by gently tapping it with a large, sturdy kitchen knife. When the knife is slightly wedged in, very carefully twist and pull away from the fruit.</li>
            <li>With a smaller kitchen knife, carefully make criss-crosses in the avocado flesh, making sure not to break through the skin.</li>
            <li>Using a spoon, gently scoop out the avocado flesh and place in medium-sized bowl.</li>
            <li>Add cooked quinoa and diced tomato to the avocado pieces and gently mix together while preserving the chuncks of flesh.  For a creamier consistency, use more pressure when mixing to mash the avocado chunks.</li>
            <li>Place hollow avocado shells in baking dish, and carefully fill each with the mixture.</li>
            <li>Generously layer crumbled feta cheese over top and place in oven for <span class = 'date'>10-12 minutes</span> or until cheese is sufficiently melted.</li>
            <li>Add salt and pepper to taste, then serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>

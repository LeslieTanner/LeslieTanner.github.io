        <strong><p>Directions: </p></strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat Oven to 325 degrees F.</li>
            <li>In a VERY large mixing bowl or largest bowl of your Stand Mixer, add brown sugar, white sugar, and shortening. Cream together very well.</li>
            <li>In another large bowl, sift together flour, baking powder, and salt. Set Aside.</li>
            <li>Add flour mixture and eggs alternately to the creamed mixture, mix well, scraping down sides of bowl as needed.</li>
            <li>Dissolve baking soda in the 4 Tbs of HOT water. Add baking soda mixture and vanilla to dough and mix well.</li>
            <li>Stir in nuts and chocolate chips.</li>
            <li>Drop by heaping tablespoonful onto an ungreased cookie sheet and back at 325 degrees F for <span class='date'>15-17 minutes</span>. I get 12 cookies to a standard sized cookie sheet.</li>
        </ol>
        <strong><p>Variations/Tips: </p></strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Nuts: Can use walnuts, pecans, macadamia nuts, etc. so long as you have a total of 2 lbs. I measure each type of nut used into it's own bowl, see reason below.</li>
            <li>Chocolate Chips: I seldom use just the chocolate chips called for in the original recipe. Instead I use a combination of 3 lbs of a variety of baking pieces, and put in separate bowls. Try chocolate chunks, semisweet chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, mini M&M's, vanilla baking chps, chocolate/caramel swirled chips, etc. so long as you have a total of about 3 lbs (about 4 - 12 ounce packages) I have already used a little less than 3 lbs when I just didn't have enough available.</li>
            <li>Before adding the nuts and chocolate to your dough, divide the doug into 2 bowls. Since you have measured out the uts and chocolate (or variety of baking pieces) into separate bowls, you can now create a variety of cookie dough flavors. Add whatever combination you would like so long as you add approximately equal amounts to each bowl.</li>
            <li>FOR EXAMPLE: Divide cookie dough into 2 bowls. To first bowl add 1 pound chopped pecans, 1 pound chocolate chunks, and 1/2 pound butterscotch chips. To second bowl add 1 pound chopped walnuts, 1 pound caramel/chocolate swirled chips, and 1/2 pound vanilla baking chips. The possibilities are endless. Have fun with this!</li>
            <li>When I freeze the dough, I do use m food saver machine. I fill the food saver bag with desired amount of dough and flatten out slightly before vacuum sealing. This way the dough lays flat in the freezer to save space, and thwas more quickly. I take the dough out of the freezer and put in the fridge the day before I plan on baking.</li>
        </ul>
